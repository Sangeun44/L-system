## Aesthetic 
* Grows in 3D
* Higher probability/tendency to grow upwards
* Best is at 4th iteration
* Used webgl-obj-loader and uploaded my own 3d models
* Different shaders for flowers and the main tree
* Randomization of angles for branching and crookedness in branches
* Flowers/polyps are added

## Interactivity
*The tree re-iterates by adjusting the randomization
*The color of the coral is changeable by color selection
*You can change the number of iterations of the grammer
